                Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall
                aggression and
                often fast tempo.
                The genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex
                guitar
                stylings of
                the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk.
                <br>Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism of the Reagan Era
                and the much more
                moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of glam metal which also developed
                concurrently in
                the 1980s.<br>The genre was commercially successful during the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, with the
                "Big Four" of thrash metal – Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax – being joined by Exodus, Overkill, Testament,
                and Sepultura, as
                well as the "Big Four" and of German thrash metal: Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Tankard.

            <h2 id="title2">Metallica</h2>
            <p>
                Metallica is an American thrash metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and
                guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich.
                The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big
                four"
                bands of thrash metal. <br>Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters
                Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime
                lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth
                after being fired from
                Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.
                Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986),
                which is cited. <br>The band's next album, ...And Justice for
                All (1988), gave
                Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), achieved substantial
                commercial success and made it the best-selling album of
                the SoundScan era. <br>Metallica returned to its thrash metal
                roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of
                the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent album, 72 Seasons, was released in 2023.

            <h2 id="title2">Slayer</h2>
            <p>
                Slayer was an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California formed in 1981 by guitarists
                Kerry King and
                Jeff Hanneman, drummer Dave Lombardo and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya. Slayer's fast and aggressive
                musical style made them one of the "big four" bands of thrash metal.
                Slayer's final lineup comprised Araya, King, drummer Paul Bostaph (who replaced Lombardo in 1992 and
                again in 2013) and
                guitarist Gary Holt (who replaced Hanneman in 2013). Drummer Jon Dette was also a member of the band.
                In the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's
                music was written by King and Hanneman. <br>The band's lyrics and album art has been highly
                influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's
                third album, Reign
                in Blood (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.
                <br>Slayer released twelve studio albums, four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification 
                in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million
                copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013 and over 20 million worldwide. The band
                has received five Grammy Award nominations. After more than three decades of
                recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that it would embark on a farewell tour,
                which took place from May 2018 to November 2019, after which the band disbanded.

            <h2 id="title2">Megadeth</h2>
            <p>
                Megadeth is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist/guitarist Dave
                Mustaine. Known for their technically complex guitar work and musicianship.<br>
                In 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the
                independent record
                label Combat Records, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to
                Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. The band went on to release a number of
                platinum-selling albums,
                including So Far, So Good... So What! (1988), Rust in Peace (1990), and Countdown to Extinction (1992).
                These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition.
                Megadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for five of its sixteen studio albums, and
                has received twelve Grammy nominations. <br>Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in 2017 for the song 
                "Dystopia" in the Best Metal
                Performance category. Megadeth has
                hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since July 2005, and held its first MegaCruise
                in  October 2019.
