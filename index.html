                        Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall aggression and often fast tempo. The genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and
                        complex guitar stylings of the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk.
                        <br />
                        Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism of the Reagan Era and the much more moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of glam metal which also
                        developed concurrently in the 1980s.<br />
                        The genre was commercially successful during the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, with the "Big Four" of thrash metal – Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax – being joined by Exodus, Overkill, Testament, and
                        Sepultura, as well as the "Big Four" and of German thrash metal: Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Tankard.
