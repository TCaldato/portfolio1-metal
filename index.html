            Thrash metal (or simply thrash) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall aggression and
            often fast tempo.
            The genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex guitar stylings of
            the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk.
            Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism of the Reagan Era and the much more
            moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of glam metal which also developed concurrently in
            the 1980s.The genre was commercially successful during the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, with the "Big Four" of
            thrash metal – Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax – being joined by Exodus, Overkill, Testament, and Sepultura, as
            well as the "Big Four" of German thrash metal: Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Tankard. Some of those bands are often
            credited for helping create, develop and popularize the genre.
