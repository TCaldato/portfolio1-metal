                Thrash metal (or simply thrash) is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its overall
                aggression and
                often fast tempo.
                The genre emerged in the early 1980s as musicians began fusing the double bass drumming and complex
                guitar
                stylings of
                the new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) with the speed and aggression of hardcore punk.
                Philosophically, thrash metal developed as a backlash against both the conservatism of the Reagan Era
                and
                the much more
                moderate, pop-influenced, and widely accessible heavy metal subgenre of glam metal which also developed
                concurrently in
                the 1980s.The genre was commercially successful during the mid-to-late 1980s and early 1990s, with the
                "Big
                Four" of
                thrash metal – Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax – being joined by Exodus, Overkill, Testament,
                and
                Sepultura, as
                well as the "Big Four" and of German thrash metal: Kreator, Destruction, Sodom, and Tankard. Some of those
                bands
                are often
                credited for helping create, develop and popularize the genre.(Text extracted form the Wikipedia

                Metallica is an American thrash metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and
                guitarist JamesHetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its
                career.
                The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big
                four"
                bands of thrash metal.Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters
                Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime
                lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth
                after
                being fired from
                Metallica, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.
                Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, Master of Puppets (1986),
                which is cited
                as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, ...And Justice for
                All
                (1988), gave
                Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), was the band's first not
                to
                root
                predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial
                commercial
                success and
                selling more than 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of
                the
                SoundScan era.
                After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to
                its
                thrash metal
                roots with the release of its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar praise to that of
                the
                band's
                earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent album, 72 Seasons, was released in 2023.(Text

                Slayer was an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California formed in 1981 by guitarists
                Kerry
                King and
                Jeff Hanneman, drummer Dave Lombardo and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya. Slayer's fast and aggressive
                musical
                style made
                them one of the "big four" bands of thrash metal.
                Slayer's final lineup comprised Araya, King, drummer Paul Bostaph (who replaced Lombardo in 1992 and
                again
                in 2013) and
                guitarist Gary Holt (who replaced Hanneman in 2013). Drummer Jon Dette was also a member of the band.
                In the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's
                music was
                written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial
                killers,
                torture,
                genocide, organized crime, secret societies, occultism, terrorism, religion or antireligion, fascism,
                racism
                and war,
                have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups. However, its music has
                been
                highly
                influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's
                third
                album, Reign
                in Blood (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.
                Slayer released twelve studio albums, three live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays
                and
                a cover
                album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. Slayer
                sold 5
                million
                copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and over 20 million
                worldwide. The band
                has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song "Eyes of the Insane" and
                one in
                2008 for
                the song "Final Six", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). After more than three
                decades of
                recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that it would embark on a farewell tour,
                which
                took place
                from May 2018 to November 2019, after which the band disbanded. (Text extracted form the Wikipedia

            <p>
                Megadeth is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist/guitarist Dave Mustaine.
                Known for
                their technically complex guitar work and musicianship. Their music features complex arrangements and fast
                rhythm
                sections, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes of war, politics, religion, death, and personal
                relationships.
                In 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, on the
                independent record
                label Combat Records, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth
                signing with
                Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?, was released in 1986 and
                was a major
                hit with the underground metal scene. Band members' substance abuse issues and personal disputes had brought
                Megadeth
                negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of
                platinum-selling albums,
                including So Far, So Good... So What! (1988), Rust in Peace (1990), and Countdown to Extinction (1992).
                These albums,
                along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition.
                Megadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for five of its sixteen studio albums, and has
                received
                twelve Grammy nominations. Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in 2017 for the song "Dystopia" in the Best
                Metal
                Performance category. The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and live shows.
                Megadeth has
                hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since July 2005, and held its first MegaCruise in
                October 2019.

            <p>
                Anthrax is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed in 1981 by rhythm guitarist Scott Ian
                and bassist
                Dan Lilker.
                The band's current lineup consists of Scott Ian, drummer Charlie Benante, bassist Frank Bello, vocalist Joey
                Belladonna
                and lead guitarist Jonathan Donais. Anthrax's lineup has changed numerous times over their career, leaving
                Ian as the
                only constant member of the band. Ian and Benante (who replaced one-time drummer Greg D'Angelo in 1983) are
                the only two
                members to appear on all of Anthrax's albums, while Bello has been a membeAfter cycling through a number of
                members,
                Anthrax released their debut album, Fistful of Metal (1984), with singer Neil Turbin. r of Anthrax since
                1984, replacing
                Lilker.
                Anthrax's third full-length record Among the Living (1987) brought the band mainstream success for the first
                time, and
                is recognised as one of the greatest thrash metal albums. The band's next two outings, State of Euphoria
                (1988) and
                Persistence of Time (1990), further cemented their reputation as one of the most successful thrash metal
                bands, with the
                latter giving Anthrax their first Grammy Award nomination. In 1992, Anthrax signed to Elektra Records for
                $10 million
                and Belladonna was replaced by John Bush of Armoured Saint. Bush's first album with Anthrax, Sound of White
                Noise
                (1993), reached number seven on the Billboard 200 chart (their greatest chart success) and spawned the radio
                hit "Only".
                Anthrax's subsequent albums with Bush would experience less critical and commercial success; the band would
                part ways
                with Elektra following the release of Stomp 442 (1995) due to a lack of promotional support, and Volume 8:
                The Threat is
                Real (1998) suffered from the bankruptcy of their record label.
                Following the release of We've Come For You All (2003), which was generally regarded as a comeback for the
                band, John
                Bush left Anthrax in 2005, after which the band reunited with Belladonna and lead guitarist Dan Spitz. After
                Belladonna
                and Spitz's departure in 2007, Anthrax recruited singer Dan Nelson and commenced work on a new album,
                although Nelson
                would part ways with the band in 2009. Following a short-lived reunion with Bush, Belladonna rejoined the
                band for a
                third time in 2010. Anthrax's first album with Belladona in 21 years, Worship Music (2011) was released to
                critical and
                commercial success, reaching number twelve on the Billboard 200. The band's most recent album to date, For
                All Kings,
                was released in 2016.(Text extracted form the Wikipedia website)
