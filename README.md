## Testing

Testing information can be found in a separate testing [file](TESTING.md "Link to testing file")

- **Issues and Bugs**
  The developer ran into several issues during the development of the website, with the noteworthy ones listed below along with solutions.
  - Header Bug - A bug was found in the header when adjusting pages for responsive view on screens less than 950px wide. The header didn't cover the entire width, leaving a white background behind. After checking the header code and finding no issue, I proceeded to check the CSS code after the heading. I discovered that the problem was caused by the width of the first image in the first section. I fixed the problem by setting the width to 1200px.
  - Back-to-top Button Issue - A bug was found in the Back-to-top Button, which was not appearing at all. The code used for the button was taken from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/#gsc.tab=0) which included JavaScript. I realize that similar to CSS, JavaScript has to be linked to an HTML page so, researching on the same website, I found how to link the script.js to index.html. Using <script src="./script.js"></script> resolves the issue.
  - Centralizing the Form - There was a bug when attempting to center the form on the Sign Up page, which occurred when making the page responsive. During a mentoring session with Owonikoko Oluwaseun, we found a solution on the [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css) website using CSS properties such as position: absolute; left: 50%; top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%) translateX(-50%); the issue was successfully resolved.
